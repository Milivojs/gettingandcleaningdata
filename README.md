Week 4 peer grade assigment

The purpose of this assigment is to tidy and clean up data concerning an experiment

The purpose of the experiment is to track human activity using smartphones, obtained data can be used to upgrade sales of 
big sport companies
  
30 volunteers (ages 19-48) were equiped with smartphones and their activities were divided into: WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING, STANDING,LAYING
  
Obtained data was divided in two sets, 70% volunteers were generating training data and 30% were generating test data

The purpose of our assigment was to merge training and test and create one dataset, extract measurments of
mean and standard deviation only, use descriptive activity names for each activity, apropriately label dataset,create an
independent dataset that contains average values for each variable from previous datasets
   
The code that solves this problem can be found both in run_analysis, since that was the directory I originaly started working
and traintest file
